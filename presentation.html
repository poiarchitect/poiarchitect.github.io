  <h1>PoIP – Project Overview</h1>
  <p>Where Proof Meets Impact. Built for Transparency, Purpose & Global Good.</p>
</header>

<div class="container">

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Core Concept</h2>
    <p>The Proof of Impact Protocol (PoIP) is a decentralized funding system that allows users to stake $POI, grow a transparent treasury, and fund verified impact bounties around the world — in areas like aid, innovation, and climate repair. All funds are traceable. All rewards are symbolic. All impact is real.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Staking</h2>
    <p>Users stake $POI to help grow the PoIP treasury. Their funds are routed into a unified, low-risk DeFi yield pool. 100% of the original $POI is returned after unstaking. As a reward, stakers receive $GROW — a symbolic token with no financial promise but social significance in the PoIP ecosystem.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Treasury Logic</h2>
    <p>The treasury operates using smart contracts with zero human custody. Yield from pooled staking and reserve capital is split 50/50: half reinvested, half allocated to verified impact bounties. All fund flows are transparent, automated, and designed for long-term sustainability. The treasury enters dual-yield mode after £50M is secured.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>AI + DAO Governance</h2>
    <p>The protocol uses an AI advisory layer to autonomously source, filter, and propose bounties from trusted NGO feeds. A DAO of $POI holders votes on approvals, treasury updates, and long-term protocol evolution. No centralized control. All decisions are publicly verifiable.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Symbolic Rewards</h2>
    <p>$GROW tokens are issued to stakers as a sign of contribution — not as profit. They represent alignment with real-world good and may unlock privileges in the future DAO (e.g. voting multipliers, social badges, or access roles). PoIP deliberately avoids speculative framing.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Transparency</h2>
    <p>All staking, treasury movements, and bounty disbursements are visible in real-time. Every funded bounty links to a public proof page. This ensures trust, encourages community validation, and builds a fully auditable history of impact.</p>
